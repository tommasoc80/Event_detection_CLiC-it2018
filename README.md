# Event_detection_CLiC-it2018

This repository contains pre-trained models (and system outputs) for event detection and classification in Italian, following the [EVENTI](https://sites.google.com/site/eventievalita2014/) evaluation exercise presented at [EVALITA 2014](http://www.evalita.it/2014).

The pre-trained models have been obtained by using a state-of-the-art Bi-LSTM-CRF system [Reimers and Gurevych, 2017](http://aclweb.org/anthology/D17-1035).
